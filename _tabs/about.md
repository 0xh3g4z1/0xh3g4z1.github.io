CSIT student at the **Egypt-Japan University of Science and Technology (E-JUST)** with a strong passion for **information technology, cybersecurity, and competitive programming**. I’m deeply motivated by the challenge of solving complex technical problems and continuously seek opportunities to grow through hands-on learning, collaboration, and competition.

As an active member of **Team W4llz**, I participate in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions and contribute as a **security content writer**. I’ve played in several international events, including **SekaICTF 2025** and **CrewCTF 2025**. My areas of focus include **web exploitation, reverse engineering, and digital forensics**, and I particularly enjoy developing detailed write-ups to help others understand the deeper mechanics of modern attack and defense techniques.

I’m also a **competitive programmer** with **Team Mission Semicolon**, where I’ve honed my problem-solving, algorithmic thinking, and teamwork skills. Our team proudly **qualified for ECPC 2025**, reflecting our continuous commitment to learning and strategic preparation.

Beyond competitions, I’ve participated in hackathons such as **NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025**, where our team built a predictive weather system.

My broader goal is to **bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical cybersecurity**, with interests spanning **ethical hacking, system security, cryptography, and network defense**. I aim to contribute to the cybersecurity community through **research, technical writing, and building secure, innovative systems**.
