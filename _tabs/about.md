CSIT student at the Egypt-Japan University of Science and Technology (E-JUST) with a strong passion for information technology, cybersecurity, and competitive programming. I am deeply driven by the challenge of solving complex technical problems and continuously seek opportunities to grow through hands-on learning, collaboration, and competition.

As an active member of the CTF team W4llz, I contribute both as a CTF player and a security content writer, focusing on topics such as web exploitation, reverse engineering, and digital forensics. I enjoy dissecting security vulnerabilities, developing educational write-ups, and helping others understand the deeper mechanics of modern attack and defense techniques.

In parallel, I am a competitive programmer with Mission Semicolon, where Iâ€™ve honed my problem-solving, algorithmic thinking, and teamwork skills. Our team successfully qualified for ECPC 2025, a milestone that reflects our dedication to continuous improvement and strategic preparation.

Beyond competitions, I am passionate about bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world cybersecurity practices, with interests spanning ethical hacking, system security, cryptography, and network defense. My ultimate goal is to contribute to the cybersecurity community through research, technical writing, and building secure, innovative systems.
